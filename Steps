Approach
1. We build 5 HTTP servers each of which returns the name when mocked 
2. We build the load balancer 
3. Load balancer will route the requests to HTTP servers, as the HTTP servers will respond back 
with name we will know which server actually got triggered 
4. We will use Round robin for routing purposes 
5. From Golang (load balancer) we want to redirect to python server 
6. We create a reverse proxy  that is like one to many servers
